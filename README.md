## Description
My take on the 1987 Nintendo classic Punch Out game. The idea was to showcase a clear understanding of mainly player movement and input, enemy ai, animations, UI Canvas, and Sound FX.



## How to Play

- You can move the  main character using either wasd or arrow keys to walk across the ring.
- Use F to strike/punch
- Use G to block/defend

At the top of the screen you should see the UI canvas which shows player and enemy health. Interactive UI includes pause, play, and restart buttons.
